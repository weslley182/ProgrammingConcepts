# CoffeeShop – Object-Oriented Programming in Practice ☕

This repository is part of a content series on YouTube, Blog, and LinkedIn focused on teaching the 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a real-world project.

## 🎯 Objective
Demonstrate **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** through a simplified coffee shop system written in C#.

## 📚 Modules

### ✅ Module 0 – Why OOP Matters + Encapsulation
- Introduction to OOP and when it makes sense
- Procedural vs OOP example
- Encapsulation with a protected `Order` class
